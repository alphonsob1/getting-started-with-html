<h1><b>Stage 0 Notes</b></h1>
<h2>How the Web Works</h2>
<p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like <a href="www.google.com"><img src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/Wx1OdscqyJkXh3vYLx6ZTxngP542hK_P2Mew1MvItbCs-GF4a0lyBfFSOfebDt9CX4Fv-omaDshdYX_obLI9=s90#w=130&h=60"  alt="www.google.com"></a> 
their computer sends a HTTP Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>HTML stands for <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b>. 
HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. 
HTML documents contain text content which describes <strong>"what you see"</strong> and markup which describes <strong><em>"how it looks"</em></strong>.

<h2>Tags and Elements</h2>
HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>.
When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <em><b>tags</b></em>.</br>
<h2>Computers are Stupid</h2>
<p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.</p>
<h2>Inline vs Block Elements </h2>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p>
